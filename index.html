        <h3>A photoessay looking at alternative Black identities</h3>
            </div>
              
               <div class="container" >
                <p> A new generation of Black Americans are emerging and expressing themselves with new styles and hobbies that fall outside of the ‘expectations’ set by society despite pushback from family members and peers. Misconceptions about Black identity have pervaded society for years; the most prominent being that the culture is a monolith that cultivates individuals that all act and think alike. This has contributed to feelings of ‘otherness’ for individuals who fall outside of this mold.</p>
          
                <p>I have chosen to amplify the voice of this group and create a yearbook where these individuals fit in by not fitting in at all. I have photographed and interviewed five Black individuals and have chosen to share their story through class pictures, quotes and superlatives. From someone with a career in alternative music to a metaphysical store owner, I am able to show these isolated individuals in their natural elements.</p>
                
                <p> Click the photos to experience The Yearbook and view class superlatives.</p>
